### Mini Weather Dashboard Technical Assessment

**Objective:** Develop a minimalistic weather dashboard that retrieves and displays weather data from an external API, following a provided Figma design.

**Project Overview:**
- You will be provided with a Figma design for a simple weather dashboard. This design includes a search bar for entering a city and a display area for showing current weather conditions.
- Your goal is to implement this design into a functional web application that meets the requirements outlined below.

**Functional Requirements:**
- **City Search:** Implement a search functionality allowing users to enter a city name and retrieve weather data for that location.
- **Current Weather Display:** Display key weather details such as temperature and an associated weather icon.

**Technical Requirements:**``
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is responsive and matches the provided Figma design for both mobile and desktop views.
- **External API Usage:** Utilize an API like OpenWeatherMap to fetch the weather data.
- **Error Handling:** Include basic error handling for situations like incorrect city input or API request failures.
- **Loading State:** Show a simple loading indication (text or animation) while the data is being fetched.

**Technologies to Use:**
- **HTML/CSS:** Use these for creating the layout and styling of your application.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** Employ vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and handling API requests.
- **Fetch API:** Use this to retrieve weather data from the external source.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- **Code Quality:** Your code should be clean, understandable, and well-organized.
- **Design Implementation:** Accurately translate the provided Figma design into a functional web page.
- **Functionality:** Ensure all basic functionalities operate as expected without bugs.
- **Usability and UX:** Your application should be straightforward and user-friendly.

**Deliverables:**
- Upload your source code to a GitHub repository. Include a README with instructions on how to set up and run your project. A live demo is recommended but not required given the time constraints.

**Time Management Suggestions:**
- Spend the first 10-15 minutes reviewing the API documentation and planning your implementation strategy.
- Dedicate approximately 30-40 minutes to setting up your HTML and CSS to match the Figma design.
- Use the following 40-50 minutes to integrate the JavaScript functionality for fetching and displaying the weather data.
- Allow the final 15-20 minutes for thorough testing, debugging, and polishing your application.

This assessment is designed to evaluate your core skills in web development: following design specifications, integrating with APIs, and crafting a functional front-end application. Manage your time effectively to showcase your best abilities. Good luck!
